:abstract: The Lisp Educational Network Simulator (LENS) project is an
  attempt to develop a Packet Network Simulator using good design
  principles and appropriate abstractions to make it easy to
  understand and extend and more suitable for educational use.

  Lisp was chosen as a particularly suitable language for this
  task. Firstly Lisp can be used interactively allowing interactive
  use of simulations with full introspective capabilities of all
  aspects of the model - even while a simulation is are running. It is
  a particularly good language on which to overlay a problem domain
  specific language - something needed in a simulation environment. As
  a programming language it does not limit design choices and
  paradigms as many other languages do and so supports whatever
  abstractions best suit the problem space.
